A two-sided 11-a-side bat-and-ball team game, in which the object is
to score the most runs.  It originated in England among shepherds using
their crooks as bats; its rules were laid down in 1744 and the game is
played almost exclusively in the UK and its former empire. It is presided
over by two umpires (from 1993 in test matches a third umpire can make
decisions on stumpings and runnings out from the stand using video replays).
<P>
It is played on a large field; the pitch is a strip of grass 22yards (20.12 m)
long having at each end of a wicket of three stumps surmounted by two bails.
The cork and twine ball, encased in leather, is 8.8-9 inches (22.4-22.9 cm)
in circumference and weighs 5.5-5.75 ounces (155.9-163 g).  
<P>
The members of one team take turns to bat in pairs, one defending each wicket;
the batsman’s objective is to score runs by hitting the ball and exchanging e
ends before the ball is returned to the pitch.  A four is scored if the ball
is hit to the edge of the field, a six if the ball reaches the edge without
bouncing after leaving the bat; the batsman can decline to run yet still
score runs in these latter two circumstances.  Other types of run can be
scored by the bowlers producing illegal deliveries. Each player bats until
he is bowled, caught, stumped, run out or judged lbw (leg before wicket).
 The members of the other team field, some taking turns to bowl the ball.
 After every over of six balls (sometimes eight in Australia) the bowler
changes, the new bowler bowling from the other wicket.
<P>
A match consists of one or two innings and may last for a few hours or
up to six days.  International cricket, governed by the International
Cricket Conference, is played mainly in Test matches between England,
Australia, the West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Pakistan,
and Sri Lanka.  The governing body in each country decides which teams
are first class; in England first-class cricket chiefly involves the
18 professional first class county teams.
