This archive contains Michael Covington's editor PrEd, 
suitable for use in the Prolog2 environment.  A call to 
edit in Prolog2 will look for an appropriate editing 
command, just as though you had typed "edit" at the DOS
prompt.  ESL provided the sample edit.bat.  We have modified 
edit.bat tocall PrEd.  You may need predbw instead, 
for monochrome screens.  PrEd contains online help, and 
further details are in pred.doc.

Expert Systems Ltd. is no longer in business but the author of ESL 
Prolog, Tony Dodd (tony@dodd.demon.co.uk), is still supporting ESL 
Prolog as best he can.  Before contacting him, please read the following information.

HOW TO MAKE ESL PROLOG EDINBURGH-COMPATIBLE

If you add the declaration

:- state(token_class,_,dec10).

at the beginning of your program, ESL Prolog will become almost 100%
compatible with Edinburgh Prolog (described in Clocksin & Mellish's
_Programming in Prolog_ and many other books).  

Without this declaration, the main differences between ESL Prolog and
Edinburgh (de facto standard) Prolog are:
  - In ESL, % does not introduce a comment.
  - In ESL, strings ("like this") are not lists of integers; they are
a special data type.


WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

ESL Prolog is described in the following books, all of which are still
available through any bookseller that handles special orders.

Dodd, A. (1990).  _Prolog:  a logical approach_.  Oxford:  Oxford
University Press.

Dodd, Tony.  _The Prolog-2 User Guide_ and _The Prolog-2 Encyclopaedia_.
Ablex.

ESL Public Domain Prolog was created to serve as a free sample of a
commercial product, and as such does not contain online documentation.

Prolog-2 Public Domain

Version 2.30 - IBM PC

1. Installation on hard disk

There is no special installation procedure for Prolog-2; simply make 
a directory called, for example, PROLOG2 on your hard disk and copy 
all the diskettes supplied into it. Then test your installation by 
typing PROLOG2. 

2. Installation on floppy disks

It is also possible to run Prolog-2 from a floppy disk. Make a backup
copy before doing this. 

3. CONFIG.SYS

You  must also have a file CONFIG.SYS on the disk from  which  you 
boot DOS - you may have one already.

Your CONFIG.SYS file must contain the statement

FILES=20

otherwise you will get system errors during startup. Once you have 
added  this  line to the file,  reboot the machine for it to  take
effect.

4. Editor

The full Prolog-2 system has an integrated editor. In this version
a predicate edit/1 is supplied to allow files to be edited; specify
the name of the file as an argument. The file is automatically
reconsulted after editing. Thus

?- edit(foo).

edits FOO.PRO and reconsults it. edit/1 works by invoking a batch
file EDIT.BAT with the file as argument. A sample EDIT.BAT that invokes
WordStar is supplied; edit it to invoke your normal editor. Note that
only 128000 bytes are free for editing. If you need more, the form

?- edit(foo,200000).

for example will free 200000 bytes of memory.

5. Legalese

This Prolog system is the freeware version of Prolog-2 from Expert
Systems Ltd. You are encouraged to copy this disk, subject to the
restriction that you must not delete or change any of the supplied
files without the permission of ESL (on the other hand, if you want to
ship your own Prolog program you are free to add files).

There is no registration fee for this version of Prolog-2, and the
product is not supported. But if you upgrade to another version
of Prolog-2 you can use the ESL bulletin board or the help line to
report problems and request new versions.

This public domain was originally developed for the Open University
to be shipped with their MIKE Expert System. Their help and advice
in assembling this package is gratefully acknowledged.
