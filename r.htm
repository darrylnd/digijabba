<H4> English Alphabet : The Letter R </H4>
</B>
</CENTER>
The English letter <B> R </B> is generally traced back to the old 
Egyptian hieroglyph <I> Missing Heiroglyph that looks like a fallen
over narrow ellipse or pursed lips </I> representing a mouth. Written
in a running hand (the so-called hieratic form) it became <I>
Yet another missing hieroglyph looking like a one-legged grasshopper
looking right with no wings or antennae </I>. The Phoenicians, 
writing on stone, gave it a more angular form <I> Yet another symbol
looking like a thick-lined right-angled triangle with an extented right
verticle protruding below the horizontal base </I> and called it <I> 
resh </I>, meaning "head", from its fancied resemblance to the head 
supported by the neck. The Greeks turned it around (reflected about 
a vertical axis), and then later rounded it it so that it looked just 
like the capital letter P in the orthodox twentieth century English 
alphabet.
<P>
Of course, if the alphabet had stayed like that, we would then have had
two letters with exactly the same form - confusing n'est ce pas! - 
and this is only one letter from the 26 and the capitals at that. 
The Greeks then added a little tail, which made the letter <B>R</B> 
as we have to-day. The Romans kept the form, but the Greeks, who had
developed the letter <I>PI (Yet another symbol)</I> for P, dropped 
the tail again, so their R (Rho) is written P. Of course there is 
also the Nordic influence from the stark runic forms through various 
middle age variations; typically in these alphabets, the letter R is 
more angular (one large vertical and three shorter lines of inflection) 
and reflects the the use of stone as a carrier medium.
<P>
No other consonant shows so many variations in pronunciation. In France 
and Germany, it is rolled. In Portugal it can be breathy or hard and 
rolled dependent upon its context. In Great Britain and North America 
it varies according to the locality.
