<H4> English Alphabet : The Letter A </H4>
</B>
</CENTER>
The first letter of the English alphabet, <I>A</I>, grew
from the Egyptian heiroglyphic representation of an eagle.
In the iconic Egyptian written vocabulary the eagle first
had its proper shape like this: <I>Missing Heiroglyph
depicting an eagle at rest, wings folded, sat erect upon a 
flat base looking to the left</I>. Then as it came to be made 
by the Egyptian scribe, writing in a running hand, it was 
simplified to this: <I>Missing Aquaglyph (my term of reference) 
that depicts a striped snake looking erect and about to strike 
to the left and arched from its curvy base first from left to 
right and then right to left to its head</I>.
<P>
When the letter in this second form passed over into the Phoenician
alphabet and was used in stone inscriptions, it was found easier to 
carve by using straight strokes of the chisel, and was made like this:
<I>Missing symbol that looks like a capital V on its side and open 
to the right and with an oar running slightly off the vertical and then
left to right - which could be interpreted as a human-like entity moving
a plank from right to left via means of a paddle!</I>
<P>
It was left to the Greeks to adopt this form for their letter <I>alpha</I>, 
rightening it and then gradually straightening it until in its classic 
form <B>a slightly curved A</B>, it was little different from the English
capital form. In the runic (and medieval English alphabets) forms, 
derived from the Nordic alphabets carved in stone, the letter A is 
represented by two large obliques resting (at their apex) on each other 
and bound with a short horizontal.
