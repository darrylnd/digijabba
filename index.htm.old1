A pause for thought (courtesy of some cognitive science students):

<DD>Electricity is the movement of electrons.
<DD>Electrons have mass, velocity, spin etc.
<DD>Does this mean that electricity has mass, velocity, spin etc. ?
<DD>Computers run on electricity.
<DD>Does this mean that computational processes have an electro-mass?
<DD>Are they Newtonian or Quantuum in terms of their dynamics?
