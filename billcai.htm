MIT is admired around the world as a crucible of creative thought,
a force for progress, a place where dreams of generations become
reality. The remarkable discoveries and inventions of the MIT
community have transformed America. Early in your history, MIT was
known for advances in geology and mining. By mid-century, MIT
pioneered X rays and radar. Today, it's atomic lasers, 
<b>artificial intelligence</b>, biotechnology.
MIT has done much to make this the American century.
And MIT will do more to make America and the world a better
place in the 21st century, as we continue our astonishing
journey through the information revolution.
