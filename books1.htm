<H2> <B> Reading  List For Introduction To Expert Systems and Knowledge
Representation </B> </H2>

<P>
Here are some introductory books that students doing AI will find
helpful for this course on Expert Systems.
New books are often published, so a list like this cannot
cover all the relevant books. This list is merely illustrative and
other texts in libraries and book shops may be as good or better.

<H2> Course Core Book </H2>

Jackson, P. (1990)
<BR>  An Introduction To Expert Systems (2nd Edition) Addison-Wesley.
<BR>  (If you buy one book on expert systems, buy this one.  Well
written, it covers the wide diversity of topics associated with expert
systems and this course. It is referenced in the suggested readings of nearly
all the lectures.)

<H2> General AI Books </H2>

Rich, E. and Knight, K.. (1991)
